## P: Understanding the Problem ##

- Understand the rules / define the boundaries of the problem
- Assess available information
- _Explicit Rules_: Those clearly stated in the problem description
- _Implicit Rules_: Those not stated in the problem description, but can be extrapolated from your understanding of the problem based on:
  - Problem analyses
  - Examples / Test cases
- Extracting implicit & explicit rules establishes boundaries which helps us form a mental model for how to solve the problem
- _Don't rush this step. A proper understanding of the problem is critical._

### General Example ###
